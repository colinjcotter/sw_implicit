\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\section{Formulation}\label{sec:formul}

In this article we restrict the focus to compatible finite elements,
i.e. finite elements derived from a discrete de Rham complex as
detailed in \citet{arnold2006finite,arnold2018finite}, and discussed
for geophysical fluid dynamics in
\citet{cotter2012mixed,gibson2019compatible}. We shall refer to the
H(div) finite element space as $V$ and the corresponding discontinuous
finite element space as $Q$.

We consider the shallow water equations on the rotating sphere (centre
the origin, with radius $R$),
\begin{align}
  u_t + (u\cdot \nabla)u + fu^{\perp} + g\nabla (D+b) & = 0, \\
  D_t + \nabla(uD) & = 0,
\end{align}
where $u$ is the velocity (constrained to be tangential to the
sphere), $f=2f_0 z/R$ is the Coriolis parameter (for a sphere with
rotation rate $f_0$), $u^{\perp}=k\times u$ where $k$ is the unit
vector tangential to the surface of the sphere, $g$ is the
acceleration due to gravity, $D$ is the depth of the fluid, and $b$ is
the height of the bottom boundary.

There are a few different ways to treat the advective nonlinearity
numerically, and for example, we will use the spatial discretisation
of \citet{gibson2019compatible}, namely to find time dependent
$u\in V$ and $D\in Q$, 
\begin{align}
  \int_{\Omega}{w}\cdot\pp{{u}}{t}\diff x
  - \int_\Omega {u}\cdot\nabla^\perp ({u}^\perp\cdot{w})\diff x
  + \int_\Gamma\jump{{n}^\perp({u}^\perp\cdot{w})}\cdot\widetilde{{u}}\diff S\nonumber\\
  + \int_\Omega{w}\cdot (f{u}^\perp) \diff x
  - \int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot{w} \left(g(D + b)
  + \frac{1}{2}|{u}|^2 \right)\diff x &=0,\, \forall w\in V, \label{eq:weakVISWE-A}\\
  \int_{\Omega}\phi\pp{D}{t}\diff x - \int_{\Omega}D({u}\cdot\nabla)\phi\diff x
  + \int_{\Gamma} \jump{{u}\phi}\widetilde{D}\diff x
  &= 0,\label{eq:weakVISWE-B} \forall \phi \in Q,
\end{align}
where $\Gamma$ is the set of all interelement facets,
$\jump{a}=a^+-a^-$ (with the $+$ and $-$ indices indicating the values
of fields on the two arbitrarily labelled sides of each facet), $n$ is
the unit normal pointing from the $+$ side to the $-$ side of each
facet, and $\tilde{a}$ indicates the value of a field $a$ evaluated on
the upwind side of a facet, i.e. the side where ${u}\cdot{n}<
0$. However, other treatments of the nonlinearity are possible within
this framework.  To make this agnosticism clear, we write the spatial
semidiscretisation in the following more general form,

\begin{align}
  \int_{\Omega}{w}\cdot\pp{{u}}{t}\diff x
  + A(u,w)
\nonumber\\
  + \int_\Omega{w}\cdot (f{u}^\perp) \diff x
  - \int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot{w} g(D + b)\diff x &=0,\, \forall w\in V, \label{eq:weakVISWE-A2}\\
  \int_{\Omega}\phi\pp{D}{t}\diff x
  + B(D,u,\phi)
  &= 0,\label{eq:weakVISWE-B2} \forall \phi \in Q.
\end{align}
After discretisation using using the implicit midpoint rule or the
Crank-Nicholson rule, we obtain a coupled nonlinear system to solve
for $u^{n+1}$, $D^{n+1}$, the field values at the next timestep, given
$u^n$ and $D^n$. One Newton iteration of this system then takes the
form
\begin{align}
  \int_{\Omega}{w}\cdot v\diff x
  + \beta A_u(u;v,w)
\nonumber\\
  + \beta \int_\Omega{w}\cdot (f{v}^\perp) \diff x
  - \beta \int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot{w} gh \diff x &=-R_u[w],\, \forall w\in V, \label{eq:Newton-A}\\
  \int_{\Omega}\phi h\diff x
  + B_u(D,u;v,\phi)
  + B_D(D,u;h,\phi)
  &= -R_D[\phi],\label{eq:Newton-B} \forall \phi \in Q,
\end{align}
where $u$ are $D$ are the current iterative approximations for
$u^{n+1}$ and $D^{n+1}$, $h$ and $v$ are the iterative corrections,
$\beta=\Delta t/2$, $\Delta t$ is the timestep, $R_u[w]$, $R_D[\phi]$
are the residuals, $A_u$ is the linearisation of $A$, and $B_u$ and
$B_D$ are the linearisations of $B$ with respect to $u$ and $D$,
respectively. It is this coupled system for $v$ and $h$ that we aim to
solve using an iterative method.

The goal of the augmented Lagrangian technique is to modify these
systems such that the Schur complement to Equations
(\ref{eq:Newton-A}-\ref{eq:Newton-B}) (obtained by eliminating $v$) is
easier to precondition. This is done by returning to Equations 
(\ref{eq:weakVISWE-A2}-\ref{eq:weakVISWE-B2}) and adding the term
\begin{equation}
  \gamma \left(
  \int_{\Omega}(\nabla\cdot w)\pp{D}{t}\diff x
  + B(D,u,\nabla\cdot w)  \right)
\end{equation}
to Equation \eqref{eq:weakVISWE-A2}. This changes the equation, but
not the solution, due to the discrete de Rham condition $w\in
V\implies \nabla\cdot w\in Q$, so this equation will vanish whenever
\eqref{eq:weakVISWE-B2} is satisfied, by substituting
$\phi=\nabla\cdot w$. The result is that we obtain the following
modification to the Newton update,
\begin{align}
  \int_{\Omega}{w}\cdot v\diff x
  + \beta A_u(u;v,w)
    + \beta \int_\Omega{w}\cdot (f{v}^\perp) \diff x
\nonumber\\
- \beta \int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot{w} gh \diff x
+  \gamma\int_{\Omega}(\nabla\cdot w) h\diff x \nonumber \\
  + \gamma\left(B_u(D,u;v,\nabla\cdot w)
  + B_D(D,u;h,\nabla\cdot w)\right)
&=-R_u[w] - \gamma R_D[\nabla\cdot w],\, \forall w\in V, \label{eq:NewtonAL-v}\\
  \int_{\Omega}\phi h\diff x
  + B_u(D,u;v,\phi)
  + B_D(D,u;h,\phi)
  &= -R_D[\phi],\label{eq:NewtonAL-h} \forall \phi \in Q,
\end{align}

We now consider the iterative solution of this system by
a Schur complement solver that (approximately) forms
the Schur complement system by eliminating $v$ to get a
single system for $h$. This is implemented by a matrix-free
Krylov method that applies the action of the Schur complement
on $h$ by composing the (approximate) inverse matrix in
the $v-w$ block with the pressure gradient and $B_u$ matrices.
This Krylov method then needs a preconditioner for efficient
solution.

The preconditioner is derived by considering the approximate form of
the Schur complement operator for large $\gamma$. Here we perform
this derivation by considering that the Schur complement system is
equivalent to solving the equation
\begin{equation}
    \int_{\Omega}\phi h\diff x
  + B_u(D,u;v,\phi)
  + B_D(D,u;h,\phi)
  = -R'_D[\phi], \forall \phi \in Q,
\end{equation}
subject to the constraint
\begin{align}
  \int_{\Omega}{w}\cdot v\diff x
  + \beta A_u(u;v,w)
    + \beta \int_\Omega{w}\cdot (f{v}^\perp) \diff x
\nonumber\\
- \beta \int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot{w} gh \diff x
+  \gamma\int_{\Omega}(\nabla\cdot w) h\diff x \nonumber \\
  + \gamma\left(B_u(D,u;v,\nabla\cdot w)
  + B_D(D,u;h,\nabla\cdot w)\right) = 0,
\end{align}
for appropriately modified residual $R'_D$. Formally, we expand the
solution of this constraint equation asymptotically for large $\gamma$
as $v=v_0 + \gamma^{-1}v_1 + \mathcal{O}(\gamma^{-2})$. At leading
order, we recover
\begin{equation}
  \int_{\Omega}\phi h\diff x
  + B_u(D,u;v_0,\phi)
  + B_D(D,u;h,\phi)
  = 0,
\end{equation}
due to the compatibility condition that $\nabla\cdot$ is a surjective
operator from $V$ to $Q$. At the next order, we get
\begin{align}
  \int_{\Omega}{w}\cdot v_0\diff x
  + \beta A_u(u;v_0,w)
  + \beta \int_\Omega{w}\cdot (f{v_0}^\perp) \diff x
  \nonumber\\
  - \beta \int_{\Omega}\nabla\cdot{w} gh \diff x
  + \beta B_u(D,u;v_1,\nabla\cdot w)
  = 0,
\end{align}
and we obtain the approximate Schur complement equation,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\gamma}\left(\beta \int_{\Omega}\phi gh \diff x
  -\int_{\Omega}{w_\phi}\cdot v_0\diff x
  - \beta A_u(u;v_0,w_\phi)
  - \beta \int_\Omega{w_\phi}\cdot (f{v_0}^\perp) \diff x\right)
  = R'_D[\phi], \, \forall \phi \in Q,
\end{equation}
where $w_\phi$ is the unique element of $\zeta^\perp$ such
that $\nabla\cdot w_\phi=\phi$, with
\begin{equation}
  \zeta^\perp = \left\{ w\in V: \int_\omega w\cdot v \diff x
  = 0, \, \forall v\in \zeta\right\},
\end{equation}
and $\zeta$ is the subspace of $V$ such that $v\in\zeta\implies
\nabla\cdot v=0$.

A non-rigorous inspection of this equation suggests that the second
and fourth terms are lower order compared to the first term (because
$w_\phi$ is something like an anti-Laplacian applied to $\phi$), and
we optimistically also hope that the third term can also be
neglected. Hence, we propose to precondition the Schur complement
solver with the operator $\tilde{S}:Q\to Q$ defined by
\begin{equation}
  \int_\Omega \phi Sh \diff x = \frac{\beta g}{\gamma}\int_\Omega
  \phi h \diff x, \quad \forall \phi \in Q, h \in Q.
\end{equation}
The only potential problem with this strategy is that the
second term is dominating in the limit of small $\beta$ (i.e. small
timesteps) and the second term is unbounded from below; we shall
revisit this concern in the results.
