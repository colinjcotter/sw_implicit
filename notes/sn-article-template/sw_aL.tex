\abstract{ We describe augmented Lagrangian for fully implicit time
  discretisations of the rotating shallow water equations on the
  sphere, where the spatial discretisation is constructed using
  compatible finite element methods. The solver allows for large
  timesteps, in fact the convergence is quicker with large $\Delta t$,
  and the convergence rate is mesh independent. We demonstrate these
  claims using numerical experiments.}
