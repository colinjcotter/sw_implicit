A shallow water paper

* Numerical experiments

** implicit

- [ ] get a handle on the correct suite of options
  main issues are: dt, dt=3 gives FASTER convergence!
- [ ] demonstrate mesh independence at fixed dt
- [ ] a plot to show that it isn't nonsense
- [ ] a plot to show dt dependence

** semi-implicit 

- [ ] list of maximum dts
dtmax for ref 7 is 0.03 hours
